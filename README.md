## 🚀 Key Features

*   **📸 Instant Diagnosis**: Upload or capture photos of potato leaves for instant disease identification (Early Blight, Late Blight, or Healthy).
*   **🛡️ AI Robustness (TTA)**: Uses **Test-Time Augmentation** (5-way prediction averaging) to ensure accurate results even with low-quality field photos.
*   **💬 Multilingual AI Assistant**: An integrated chatbot powered by **Google Gemini** that provides expert advice in **English, Hindi (हिंदी), and Marathi (मराठी)**.
*   **🌱 Smart Filtering**: Local color-analysis filters reject non-leaf images automatically, saving API costs and improving speed.
*   **📰 Agricultural Blog**: Curated, multilingual articles on disease prevention and crop optimization.
*   **🎨 Glassmorphic UI**: A premium, modern web interface with camera integration and real-time feedback.

## ⚡ Quick Start: Local Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aastha-9/LeafGlimpse-AI-Based-Potato-Plant-Disease-Detection-System.git
    cd LeafGlimpse-AI-Based-Potato-Plant-Disease-Detection-System
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `api/` folder:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the Unified Server**:
    ```bash
    cd api
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
    *Visit: http://localhost:8000*
